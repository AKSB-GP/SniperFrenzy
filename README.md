# Sniper Frenzy

## About the Game
A project focused on creating a simple but frantic gameloop for the Quest 2 platform. For the project I wanted to explore various aspects of XR interactions with a toon style as well as explore the general game-development cycle.
All asssets except  textures and sounds were made from scratch. Assets such as the enemy, the rifle, and level were modelled, rigged and animated in Blender-3D.

## Features
- **Weapon Handling**: The weapon interaction replicates a boltaction rifle with the user needing to cycle each rocket between firing. Magazines are attachable using a socket interactor with the animation of the boltcycling consisting of blendtrees and interaction colliders.

- **Custom grab Interactable** The rifle is can be held two handed and to make the experience m,ore enjoyable a custom XR grab was implemtend allowing for more dynamic attachpooints.
- 
- **Customaziable gameloop**: Gameloop can be adjusted with maximum amount of enemies, spawnintervals, minimum and-maximum distances, movement speed etc.

- **Toon shading**: I wanted various shaders technics such as scope shaders and toon shading technics using both HLSL and Shadergraph.
